# TurboFormulator
TurboFormulator – a "small" script for emulating a simple relational database with Google Forms as the input and Google Sheets as the output.

See the [main.gs](https://github.com/prochazkaml/TurboFormulator/blob/master/main.gs) file for instructions on how to install the script.

This little script includes several outstanding features, such as:
- saving answers submitted from Google Forms into a Google Sheet, sorted
  into the correct sheets and columns (shocking, I know)
- if a table column requires an ID, it will automatically translate the answer
  into an ID pointing to another table (alright, this is a bit more interesting)
- if a table, which another table depends on (= if that another table contains
  a list containing values from this table), gets updated with a new value,
  it will automatically update the list in Google Forms for the other table
  with the new values (actually really neat)
- quite universal (see below for setup instructions)

Created for my ICT homework, but I guess it can also be useful elsewhere.

# Setup instructions

To set this script up for yourself, create a new Form, open the Apps Script
editor and overwrite anything there is with this entire script.

Then, create a new Spreadsheet and copy its ID into the `spreadsheetID` constant
in this script's user configuration section (right below this wall of text).
The script will use this ID to save the answers to the spreadsheet when
the form is submitted.

For example, if the URL of your new Spreadsheet looks like this:

```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1abWjgQ-mJK2dE7-5SWdm9NXFbnpNDZBXyzATpt-Cwko/edit
```

then the ID is the middle bit:

```
1abWjgQ-mJK2dE7-5SWdm9NXFbnpNDZBXyzATpt-Cwko
```

Just paste that into the `spreadsheetID` constant's contents, so that the line
of code looks like this:

const spreadsheetID = "1abWjgQ-mJK2dE7-5SWdm9NXFbnpNDZBXyzATpt-Cwko";

## What is a relational databaase?

A relational database is a method of storing data into separate tables,
which in some way depend on each other.

As an example, let's say that you run a library. In the simplest form,
you need to track 3 different pieces of information: books, bookkeepers
and orders (you should probably also track the readers, but we're simplifying
here). So you create 3 tables: Books, Bookkeepers and Orders.

The Books table will contain the titles of the books, their authors' name
and their release dates. The Bookkeepers table will contain only their
names and surnames.

Where it gets interesting is the Orders table. The Orders table should track
the reader's name, the return date, the borrowed book and the bookkeeper.
However, you don't want to repeat the information about the book and bookkeeper
in this table. Instead, you simply want to point to an existing entry
in the Books and Bookkeepers table, and just giving the user a list of
possible existing options. (In Google Forms, this would be the Drop-down
list dialog).

This can be done, because each entry in each table has a unique key to
that particular table. If another table wants to reference it (i.e. if you
want to point to a book in the Books table from the Orders table), it
just stores its ID.

That's what this script does. It automatically populates the Google Forms
list dialog with the correct values from the other table, and when the Form
is submitted, it will only store the value's ID. Neat, huh?

NOTE: WHEN THE LIST DIALOG VALUES HAVE BEEN GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT THE VALUES!!!
They contain hidden Unicode characters, in which the value's ID is encoded for
faster lookup. (Hunting the value from the other table is way slower than just
decoding the ID from the value. Trust me, I tried that already).

## Form setup

The Form and Spreadsheet have to be set up in a specific way. We shall start
with the Form. It must contain a radio button dialog in the beginning
of the Form, which will take the user to a specific section, where they
will fill out the answers for that particular section.

You may create as many sections as you wish, however, only one can be submitted
at one time. The flow chart of your Form should therefore look like this:

```
Start -> Radio button -+-> Section 1 -> Form submit
                       |
                       +-> Section 2 -> Form submit
                       |
                       +-> Section 3 -> Form submit
```

There must only be the intro screen with the radio button selection and only
a single section that the user has chosem by the radio button selection.
After that single section, the form must be submitted.

If your Form looks anywhere like this:

```
Start -> Radio button -+-> Section 1 -> Section 4 -> Form submit
                       |
                       +-> Section 2 -> Form submit
                       |
                       +-> Section 3 -> Form submit
```

or like this:

```
Start -> Radio button -+-> Section 1
                       |       ↓
                       +-> Section 2 -> Form submit
                       |
                       +-> Section 3 -> Form submit
```

or like this:

```
Start -> Section 1 -> Radio button -+-> Section 2 -> Form submit
                                    |
                                    +-> Section 3 -> Form submit
                                    |
                                    +-> Section 4 -> Form submit
```

or anything of that nature, then it is INVALID. DO NOT USE ANY OF THESE,
THE SCRIPT WILL SIMPLY NOT WORK CORRECTLY.

## Section setup

In each section, you can put as many different elements as you want.
Here, however, comes the special sauce of this script: automatically
generating the list values based upon another table. To do that, just
add to the list's description the contents of the `formListDescStart`
constant as well as the table name you want to fetch values from.
After that, in brackets, include the values from the other table
which should be combined to create entries in the list (if there are
more, they should separated by commas).

For example, when the `formListDescStart` constant is "Values from: "
and the table you want to fetch values is called "Books", and you want
to give the user the book's name and its author, then the description
should be "Values from: Books (Title, Author's name)" (without quotes, of course).
The resulting list would look like this:

```
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Choose                                               V |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone J. K. Rowling |
|                                                        |
| The Hobbit, or There and Back Again J. R. R. Tolkien   |
|                                                        |
| The Fellowship of the Ring J. R. R. Tolkien            |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
```

As the list will be automatically generated, you can put any options in there
(since Google Forms don't allow an empty list), this script will automatically
overwrite everything when a new entry in the other table appears.

To make sure the answers from each section goes into the right table,
each section's title has to of course be titled in a specific way as well.
Add the contents of the `formSectionNameStart` constant to the section's title
as well as the table name where you want to store this section's answers.

For example, when the `formSectionNameStart` constant is "New entry in: "
and the table you want to fetch values is called "Bookkeepers", then the
description should be "New entry in: Bookkeepers" (again, without quotes).

The `formSectionNameStart` as well as `formListDescStart` constants
can be changed to your liking in this script's user configuration section
(right below this wall of text).

That's it for the Form, now is the time to set up the Spreadsheet!

## Spreadsheet setup

The Spreadsheet is actually quite simple. Firstly, for each of the Form's
sections, create a separate table (sheet). So, if your Form contains
the following sections:

- "New entry in: Books"
- "New entry in: Bookkeepers"
- "New entry in: Readers"

then the Spreadsheet must contain the following tables:

- "Books"
- "Bookkeepers"
- "Orders"

Each table has the first row dedicated for the column labels. Each column
label is dedicated to one Form element and it contains its exact title.
The first column is special, as it is the entry ID. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING
ELSE IN THERE!

So, let's say that the "Books" section in the Form contains the following:

- Short text answer, title "Title"
- Short text answer, title "Author's name"
- Date, title "Release date"

Then the "Books" table of the Spreadsheet should look like this:

```
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+--------
| ID            | Title         | Author's name | Release date  |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+--------
|               |               |               |               |
```

A column with an unrelated label, which is not present in the Form, will
be ignored. This is so that you may add your own formulas to the table,
if you so desire.

One exception to this naming convention is for the automatically generated
lists (whose description contains the contents of the `formListDescStart`
constant), in which case you add "ID" after the column label, so if the
list's title is "Book", then the column label is "BookID".

Let's say that the "Orders" section in the Form contains the following:

- Short text answer, title "Reader name"
- Drop-down list, title "Book", description "Values from: Books (Name, Author)"
- Drop-down list, title "Bookkeeper", description "Values from: Bookkeepers (Name, Surname)"
- Date, title "Return date"

Then the "Orders" table of the Spreadsheet should look like this:

```
+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------
| ID           | Reader name  | BookID       | BookkeeperID | Return date  |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------
|              |              |              |              |              |
```

That's it for the Spreadsheet! Simple, right?

## Finishing touches

Lastly, when everything is set up, run the installTrigger() function from the
Apps Script editor. This will install the script, making sure that it runs
anytime the Form is submitted.

And there you go! If you have set everything up correctly, by submitting
the Form, you should see the answers from a section in its corresponding
table. Note that it takes a bit of time before the data appears in
the spreadsheet, it can take up to 10 seconds.
