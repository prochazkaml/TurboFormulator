 * 
 * This little script includes several outstanding features, such as:
 * - saving answers submitted from Google Forms into a Google Sheet, sorted
 *   into the correct sheets and columns (shocking, I know)
 * - if a table column requires an ID, it will automatically translate the answer
 *   into an ID pointing to another table (alright, this is a bit more interesting)
 * - if a table, which another table depends on (= if that another table contains
 *   a list containing values from this table), gets updated with a new value,
 *   it will automatically update the list in Google Forms for the other table
 *   with the new values (actually really neat)
 * - quite universal (see below for setup instructions)
 * 
 * Created for my ICT homework, but I guess it can also be useful elsewhere.
 * 
 * ### Setup instructions
 * 
 * To set this script up for yourself, create a new Form, open the Apps Script
 * editor and overwrite anything there is with this entire script.
 * 
 * Then, create a new Spreadsheet and copy its ID into the `spreadsheetID` constant
 * in this script's user configuration section (right below this wall of text).
 * The script will use this ID to save the answers to the spreadsheet when
 * the form is submitted.
 * 
 * For example, if the URL of your new Spreadsheet looks like this:
 * 
 * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1abWjgQ-mJK2dE7-5SWdm9NXFbnpNDZBXyzATpt-Cwko/edit
 * 
 * then the ID is the middle bit:
 * 
 * 1abWjgQ-mJK2dE7-5SWdm9NXFbnpNDZBXyzATpt-Cwko
 * 
 * Just paste that into the `spreadsheetID` constant's contents, so that the line
 * of code looks like this:
 * 
 * const spreadsheetID = "1abWjgQ-mJK2dE7-5SWdm9NXFbnpNDZBXyzATpt-Cwko";
 * 
 * ### What is a relational databaase?
 * 
 * A relational database is a method of storing data into separate tables,
 * which in some way depend on each other.
 * 
 * As an example, let's say that you run a library. In the simplest form,
 * you need to track 3 different pieces of information: books, bookkeepers
 * and orders (you should probably also track the readers, but we're simplifying
 * here). So you create 3 tables: Books, Bookkeepers and Orders.
 * 
 * The Books table will contain the titles of the books, their authors' name
 * and their release dates. The Bookkeepers table will contain only their
 * names and surnames.
 * 
 * Where it gets interesting is the Orders table. The Orders table should track
 * the reader's name, the return date, the borrowed book and the bookkeeper.
 * However, you don't want to repeat the information about the book and bookkeeper
 * in this table. Instead, you simply want to point to an existing entry
 * in the Books and Bookkeepers table, and just giving the user a list of
 * possible existing options. (In Google Forms, this would be the Drop-down
 * list dialog).
 * 
 * This can be done, because each entry in each table has a unique key to
 * that particular table. If another table wants to reference it (i.e. if you
 * want to point to a book in the Books table from the Orders table), it
 * just stores its ID.
 * 
 * That's what this script does. It automatically populates the Google Forms
 * list dialog with the correct values from the other table, and when the Form
 * is submitted, it will only store the value's ID. Neat, huh?
 * 
 * NOTE: WHEN THE LIST DIALOG VALUES HAVE BEEN GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT THE VALUES!!!
 * They contain hidden Unicode characters, in which the value's ID is encoded for
 * faster lookup. (Hunting the value from the other table is way slower than just
 * decoding the ID from the value. Trust me, I tried that already).
 * 
 * ### Form setup
 * 
 * The Form and Spreadsheet have to be set up in a specific way. We shall start
 * with the Form. It must contain a radio button dialog in the beginning
 * of the Form, which will take the user to a specific section, where they
 * will fill out the answers for that particular section.
 * 
 * You may create as many sections as you wish, however, only one can be submitted
 * at one time. The flow chart of your Form should therefore look like this:
 * 
 * Start -> Radio button -+-> Section 1 -> Form submit
 *                        |
 *                        +-> Section 2 -> Form submit
 *                        |
 *                        +-> Section 3 -> Form submit
 * 
 * There must only be the intro screen with the radio button selection and only
 * a single section that the user has chosem by the radio button selection.
 * After that single section, the form must be submitted.
 * 
 * If your Form looks anywhere like this:
 * 
 * Start -> Radio button -+-> Section 1 -> Section 4 -> Form submit
 *                        |
 *                        +-> Section 2 -> Form submit
 *                        |
 *                        +-> Section 3 -> Form submit
 * 
 * or like this:
 * 
 * Start -> Radio button -+-> Section 1
 *                        |       ↓
 *                        +-> Section 2 -> Form submit
 *                        |
 *                        +-> Section 3 -> Form submit
 * 
 * or like this:
 * 
 * Start -> Section 1 -> Radio button -+-> Section 2 -> Form submit
 *                                     |
 *                                     +-> Section 3 -> Form submit
 *                                     |
 *                                     +-> Section 4 -> Form submit
 * 
 * or anything of that nature, then it is INVALID. DO NOT USE ANY OF THESE,
 * THE SCRIPT WILL SIMPLY NOT WORK CORRECTLY.
 * 
 * ### Section setup
 * 
 * In each section, you can put as many different elements as you want.
 * Here, however, comes the special sauce of this script: automatically
 * generating the list values based upon another table. To do that, just
 * add to the list's description the contents of the `formListDescStart`
 * constant as well as the table name you want to fetch values from.
 * After that, in brackets, include the values from the other table
 * which should be combined to create entries in the list (if there are
 * more, they should separated by commas).
 * 
 * For example, when the `formListDescStart` constant is "Values from: "
 * and the table you want to fetch values is called "Books", and you want
 * to give the user the book's name and its author, then the description
 * should be "Values from: Books (Title, Author's name)" (without quotes, of course).
 * The resulting list would look like this:
 * 
 * +--------------------------------------------------------+
 * | Choose                                               V |
 * +--------------------------------------------------------+
 * | Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone J. K. Rowling |
 * |                                                        |
 * | The Hobbit, or There and Back Again J. R. R. Tolkien   |
 * |                                                        |
 * | The Fellowship of the Ring J. R. R. Tolkien            |
 * +--------------------------------------------------------+
 * 
 * As the list will be automatically generated, you can put any options in there
 * (since Google Forms don't allow an empty list), this script will automatically
 * overwrite everything when a new entry in the other table appears.
 * 
 * To make sure the answers from each section goes into the right table,
 * each section's title has to of course be titled in a specific way as well.
 * Add the contents of the `formSectionNameStart` constant to the section's title
 * as well as the table name where you want to store this section's answers.
 * 
 * For example, when the `formSectionNameStart` constant is "New entry in: "
 * and the table you want to fetch values is called "Bookkeepers", then the
 * description should be "New entry in: Bookkeepers" (again, without quotes).
 * 
 * The `formSectionNameStart` as well as `formListDescStart` constants
 * can be changed to your liking in this script's user configuration section
 * (right below this wall of text).
 * 
 * That's it for the Form, now is the time to set up the Spreadsheet!
 * 
 * ### Spreadsheet setup
 * 
 * The Spreadsheet is actually quite simple. Firstly, for each of the Form's
 * sections, create a separate table (sheet). So, if your Form contains
 * the following sections:
 * 
 * - "New entry in: Books"
 * - "New entry in: Bookkeepers"
 * - "New entry in: Readers"
 * 
 * then the Spreadsheet must contain the following tables:
 * 
 * - "Books"
 * - "Bookkeepers"
 * - "Orders"
 * 
 * Each table has the first row dedicated for the column labels. Each column
 * label is dedicated to one Form element and it contains its exact title.
 * The first column is special, as it is the entry ID. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING
 * ELSE IN THERE!
 * 
 * So, let's say that the "Books" section in the Form contains the following:
 * 
 * - Short text answer, title "Title"
 * - Short text answer, title "Author's name"
 * - Date, title "Release date"
 * 
 * Then the "Books" table of the Spreadsheet should look like this:
 * 
 * +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+--------
 * | ID            | Title         | Author's name | Release date  |
 * +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+--------
 * |               |               |               |               |
 * 
 * A column with an unrelated label, which is not present in the Form, will
 * be ignored. This is so that you may add your own formulas to the table,
 * if you so desire.
 * 
 * One exception to this naming convention is for the automatically generated
 * lists (whose description contains the contents of the `formListDescStart`
 * constant), in which case you add "ID" after the column label, so if the
 * list's title is "Book", then the column label is "BookID".
 * 
 * Let's say that the "Orders" section in the Form contains the following:
 * 
 * - Short text answer, title "Reader name"
 * - Drop-down list, title "Book", description "Values from: Books (Name, Author)"
 * - Drop-down list, title "Bookkeeper", description "Values from: Bookkeepers (Name, Surname)"
 * - Date, title "Return date"
 * 
 * Then the "Orders" table of the Spreadsheet should look like this:
 * 
 * +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------
 * | ID           | Reader name  | BookID       | BookkeeperID | Return date  |
 * +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------
 * |              |              |              |              |              |
 * 
 * That's it for the Spreadsheet! Simple, right?
 * 
 * ### Finishing touches
 * 
 * Lastly, when everything is set up, run the installTrigger() function from the
 * Apps Script editor. This will install the script, making sure that it runs
 * anytime the Form is submitted.
 * 
 * And there you go! If you have set everything up correctly, by submitting
 * the Form, you should see the answers from a section in its corresponding
 * table. Note that it takes a bit of time before the data appears in
 * the spreadsheet, it can take up to 10 seconds.
